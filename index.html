<p>This game is a simple one. A color icon would be highlighted each time forming a pattern and you would need
click on that particular pattern, eg. if the green icon is highlighed at Level 1, you would need to press on to the green icon
to win that particular level and go up by one. In the next level which is level 2 you would need to remember the first icon
that was highlighed at level 1 and the current random icon which gets highlighed.You would need to click on those icon in the same
sequence for moving to the next level. And this game goes on in the same fashion. Test your Memory by checking which level
you can reach upto. Best of Luck!! </p>
